MOVIE
  Map:  colors light up when a category is 'established'
  Sidebar: 
     1. category colors of current labeling activities
     2. category colors of previous times

  colors come in, others lower opacity
  then we watch these groups disperse/mix
  then we see where everyone else is
     ?user can filter?

USER SELL:
   avoid the tourists
   avoid the perverts
   avoid the students

DATA ACQUISITION:
  Baseline data:
    1. get venues in ny that fall into categories
    2. get a bunch of venues for 'where they go'
    3. get target locations as places that trend in target categories
    4. for oauth creation, download category list
  Daily run:
    https://developer.foursquare.com/docs/multi/multi.html
       up to five requests at a time -- counts as a single request
    1. query appropriate source venues, 
          get user IDs of checkins and label the user
    2. query target locations from trending locations in target categories
    
       add a table of 'rediscovered IDs' (subset of labeled users)
            and where they are
    3. get counts of how many people are at each venue (on the hour)


  OAuth: 
    1. What categories are you?
    2. Propose a category-timerange
